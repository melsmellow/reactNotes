Graphic Designer
I took zuitt bootcamp because I want to change my career path because during this pandemic I lost my job as a graphic artist/designer and I want to pursue my coding or programming career since I graduated as B.S Information Technology in order to use my knowdledge in Tech and I really love coding since my college year so that's why I want to go back to coding.
