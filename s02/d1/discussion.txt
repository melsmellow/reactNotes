## To open our terminal under Documents directory on our file explorer, right click then select 'Open Git Bash Here' or for mac users 'New Terminal'

## To make sure that we are working on a folder, run the command on the terminal:

$ pwd

pwd - stands for present working directory, this will return your path where you are currently at

## To create a new folder under a present working directory, run command:

$ mkdir <foldername>

ex. mkdir llapitan-chris

mkdir - stands for make directory, this will make a new folder called 'llapitan-chris'

## To check if the new folder is present or already created under a present working directory, run command:

$ ls -a

ls -a stands for list all, this will give you the list of folders and files available.

## To go inside the folder we created, run command:

$ cd <foldername>

ex. cd llapitan-chris

cd - stands for change directory, and this will change your directory based on a given foldername

## To go outside a folder, run command:

$ cd ../

../ - means you will go up one level, so if your are on your own folder (llapitan-chris), and you run this, your present working directory must be on Documents now.
